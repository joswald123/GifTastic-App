This is a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the Marvel movies and also gifs of user choice.

This app works with the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

Hint: Like many APIs, GIPHY requires developers to use a key to access their API data. To use the GIPHY API, you'll need a GIPHY account and then obtain an API Key by creating an app.

When the user clicks on a button of each character, the page grabs 10 animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

We choose characters of the movies of Marvel for our theme, but the user can create a button with their own liking characters in the "Add your favourite character" box.
